# Academic Scheduler #

This is a Chrome extension that I've made for a tutoring center, where I currently work.

The main goal was to build something, that will allow us to have consistent appointment formatting (that is a nicer calendar) and make sure that there is no overbooking due to the human factor. Moreover, I wanted to build something that won't disrupt current process, but instead enchance it and will be easy to use, install and configure

Once time and course are selected one can see what tutors are available at given time and availability for a given course for whole day
